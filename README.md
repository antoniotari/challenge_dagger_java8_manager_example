# challenge dagger java8 manager example
This code is from a 6-hour challenge I did recently, with this I want to demonstrate how to use dagger and the manager design pattern along with recycle view and a randomized list.<br>
you will need my library DigiJedi included as a submodule or cloneable from here : https://github.com/antoniotari/DigiJedi.git <br>
It might have a bunch of TODOs, but remember I completed it in only 5 hours (counting a 1 hour lunch break).
